# Tweeter Project
Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. The application allows the user to create, and post tweets on the fly. In addition, the user can also view tweets posted by fellow users with the tweets being listed in descending order whereby the most recent tweet is the first listed.

While the application is responsive in design, media queries will be required in future to account for smaller screen sizes/mobile. A screen size of 768px wide or greater has been accounted for currently and the application design/layout can still be appreciated at roughly 480px wide.
